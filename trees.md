### Introduction

Trees are the most used data structure in programming and at the same time the most complex to understand. Trees are characterized by storing their nodes in a hierarchical way and not in a linear way as do lists, stacks, queues, etc.
#### Binary Trees
A binary tree is a tree that has no more than two nodes below its root. After these two nodes subtrees can be created. The nodes that reach the end of the level of the entire tree are known as leaf nodes. Nodes that contain two nodes below their level are known as parent nodes and those below them are called child nodes. Every binary tree has a single root node.

#### Binary search Trees
This type of binary tree maintains some interesting rules to order the value of the nodes entered into it. In other words, nodes with a value less than the last added node are placed to the left of it. If, on the other hand, the value of the entered node is greater, it is located to the right of it. This goes in sequence through the levels constituted in the tree. This allows to obtain an ordered binary tree.

#### Balanced binary Trees
This type of binary tree maintains some interesting rules to order the value of the nodes entered into it. In other words, nodes with a value less than the last added node are placed to the left of it. If, on the other hand, the value of the entered node is greater, it is located to the right of it. This goes in sequence through the levels constituted in the tree. This allows to obtain an ordered binary tree.
